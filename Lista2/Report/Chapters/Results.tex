\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
This section presents the main results achieved by the proposed methods. The results are divided into two parts: the first one presents the values obtained by the numerical integration using the methods implemented in this work, for all the four functions. Ther second part compares the numerical and the analytical results, discussing whether or not the error convergence is as expected.
