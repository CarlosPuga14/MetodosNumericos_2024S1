\section{Problem Presentation}\label{sec:problem-presentation}
For this work, three different functions are chosen to be numerically integrated. These functions are presented in this section, along with their analytical solutions. 

To integrate these functions, the following methods are employed: the Trapezoidal Rule, the Simpson's 1/3 Rule, the Simpson's 3/8 Rule, and the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature. The results obtained by these methods are compared with the analytical solutions, and the error convergence is analyzed.
